# LodeRunnerPyGame

My first Python Game, Lode Runner. It's a school project with my classmate Christos Pantoleon, so don't blame us much :P.

Start with the main.py.

# Controls 

With "R" key you destroy the block you are on it, left and right keys you control your movement, with the up key you go up the stairs and space you jump.

# Lode Runer Gameplay

You are trying to get away from the monsters. When you break a block and the monster traps in, he gets "killed" and it respawns. You have 5 lives, each time you get hit by a monster you lose 1 life, if you get trapped on a opened block, you are getting killed instantly. Your goal is to gather as many coins as you can.
